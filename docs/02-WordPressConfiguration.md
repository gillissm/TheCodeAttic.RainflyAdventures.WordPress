# Configuring WordPress

## Summary

WordPress by default provides solid functionality for managing basic content needs, but to get the most out of the product an extensive plugin ecosystem has developed allowing for easy extending of the core products features. By default WordPress expects to render content via PHP templates on the server, to provide the functionality to support headless (i.e. rendering of the site outside of the WordPress server), the following plugins are used.

- WP GraphQL
  - is a free, open-source WordPress plugin that provides an extendable GraphQL schema and API for any WordPress site.
- WP GraphQL Content Blocks
  - is a plugin that allows querying Gutenberg blocks using WPGraphQL. [https://faustjs.org/tutorial/get-started-with-wp-graphql-content-blocks](https://faustjs.org/tutorial/get-started-with-wp-graphql-content-blocks)
- Faust.js
  - Faust.jsâ„¢ transforms your traditional WordPress installation into a flexible headless CMS.
